### 6th semester Machine Learning project (Natural Language Processing)

**Abstract** 

Sentimental analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people’s opinion sentiments, attitude and emotion expressed in written text. Our project entitled “Sarangi” is Machine Learning based project that trains data and gives some desired predictions. It predicts the songs given as input by the user as love, happy, sad or patriotic song. These categorizations are done on the basis of the lyrics of the songs. The main aim of this project is to help users know under which categorization the song falls in and also to recommend them a few number of songs. This project is accomplished with the use of R Language. We used the packages provided by the R Language to proceed with our project.
